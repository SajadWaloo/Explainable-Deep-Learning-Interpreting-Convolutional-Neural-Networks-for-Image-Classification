# VGG16 Saliency Map Generation

This project demonstrates the generation of saliency maps using the VGG16 model. Saliency maps provide insights into the areas of an image that contribute the most to the model's prediction. The VGG16 model is a pre-trained convolutional neural network that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- NumPy (```pip install numpy```)
- TensorFlow (```pip install tensorflow```)
- Matplotlib (```pip install matplotlib```)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
3. Place your image in the project directory and update the `image_path` variable in the script to point to your image file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the script `saliency_map_generation.py` using the command: `python saliency_map_generation.py`.
6. The script will load the pre-trained VGG16 model and generate a saliency map for the provided image.
7. The original image and the corresponding saliency map will be displayed using Matplotlib.

## Saliency Map Generation

The project uses the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. It defines a function `generate_saliency_map(image)` that takes an image as input and generates a saliency map.

The saliency map is generated using gradient information. The image is preprocessed, converted to a tensor, and passed through the model. The top predicted class is extracted, and the gradient of that class with respect to the image is computed using a GradientTape. The gradient is then processed to highlight the most salient regions by taking the maximum value across color channels.

## Results

The project displays the original image and the corresponding saliency map using Matplotlib. The original image is shown on the left side, and the saliency map is shown on the right side. The saliency map highlights the regions that are most important for the VGG16 model's prediction.
